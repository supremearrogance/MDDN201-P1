						<h1>Power Poles</h1>
						<p>Power Poles (also commonly known as Overhead Power Lines) are structures used to transmit electrical energy across large areas. In suburban areas, Telecommunications also use Power Poles as a way to distribute Landline connections to households.    </p>

							<h1>Main Power Pole</h1>
							<p>The Wooden Power pole is very common in and around Central Wellington. It connects the power recieved from the local substations to the surrounding areas so that households and businesses can run their day-to-day operations.  </p>

							<h1>Secondary Power Pole</h1>
							<p>Shown above is a Secondary Power Pole which I found in the Wellington suburb of Mount Cook. Secondary Power Poles are smaller Power Poles which allow lines to connect to the main Wooden Power Poles on the other side of the street.
								As Power Poles mainly run on one side of the road, the Secondary Power Pole allows households which are on the opposing side of the street to connect directly to Main Power Lines. </p>
